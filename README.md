# Pokemon Sleep Probability Calculator

This is a web app hosted at https://pspencil.github.io/Pokemon-Sleep-Probability/.

## Main functionality

If we put a score to each ingredient variation, skill and nature, we may compute a score for each pokemon. 

Then, suppose there's at least P probability of encountering *at least one* pokemon within X encounters with scores at least C. This app allows you to compute one of P/X/C when given the other two.
